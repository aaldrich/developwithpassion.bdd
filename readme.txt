Before you try to run any of the build tasks make sure
you have ruby installed on your local machine. I would recommend running the ruby one click installer, unless you are
already familiar with setting up ruby on your local machine. You can download the one click installer from the following location:

http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/29263/ruby186-26.exe


*****All build activities are to be done with a command prompt that is pointing at the root folder******

To test: build test

To deploy: build deploy_assembly (output will go to the artifacts\deploy folder)

To open the solution: open 

To run the developwithpassion.bdddoc report (output of report will go to artifacts\developwithpassion.bdd.test.developwithpassion.bddoc.html): build run_test_report
